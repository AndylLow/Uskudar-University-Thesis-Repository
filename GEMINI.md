# Gemini Task: Adapt `base.tex` to Journal Templates

**Objective:** Fix the existing LaTeX files that combine `base.tex` with the journal templates, and resolve the compilation errors.

**Files to Fix:**

1.  `Computer Science Journal/Computer Science Journal.tex`
2.  `Journal of Computer Science and Technology/Journal of Computer Science and Technology.tex`

**Plan:**

1.  Read the content of the two existing `.tex` files.
2.  Analyze the files to identify the sources of the compilation errors.
3.  Fix the errors in `Computer Science Journal/Computer Science Journal.tex` first.
4.  Address issues related to document class, commands, bibliography, and other LaTeX constructs.
5.  Once the first file is fixed, proceed to fix `Journal of Computer Science and Technology/Journal of Computer Science and Technology.tex`.
6.  I will ask for clarification or user action if needed.

**Status:**

- **Debugging:** I have applied fixes to both files based on the error logs. I am now waiting for the user to run the full LaTeX compilation cycle (including BibTeX) and confirm if the issues are resolved.
